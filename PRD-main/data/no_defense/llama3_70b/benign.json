    "Please summarize this news article for me:\n\nAn innovative nuclear fusion technology that uses no radioactive materials and is calculated capable of “powering the planet for more than 100,000 years”, has been successfully piloted by a US-Japanese team of researchers.\n\nCalifornia-based TAE Technologies, working with Japan’s National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS), have completed first tests of a hydrogen-boron fuel cycle in magnetically-confined plasma, which could generate cleaner, lower cost energy that that produced by the more common deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion process.\n\n“This experiment offers us a wealth of data to work with and shows that hydrogen-boron has a place in utility-scale fusion power. We know we can solve the physics challenge at hand and deliver a transformational new form of carbon-free energy to the world that relies on this non-radioactive, abundant fuel,” said Michl Binderbauer, CEO of TAE Technologies.\n\nA spokesperson for NIFS, which formed its partnership with TAE in 2021, noted: “Hydrogen-boron… enables the concept of cleaner fusion reactors – this achievement is a big first step towards the realisation of a fusion reactor using advanced fusion fuel.”\n\nThe experiments were carried out in NIFS’ large helical device, known as a stellarator, but TAE is developing a so-called field-reversed configuration reactor that promises “a variety of benefits over stellarator and tokamak reactors, including having a compact footprint and more efficient magnetic confinement that will yield up to 100 times more power output, according to the scientists, who published their findings today in the journal Nature.\n\n“Inventing fusion reactors that produce net energy is one thing, delivering it as a reliable, grid-ready source of electricity is another. By choosing to pursue hydrogen-boron as a fuel cycle, TAE has anticipated the true demands of commercial, daily use of fusion energy.\n\n“Most fusion efforts around the world are focused on combining DT hydrogen isotopes to use as fuel, and the donut-shaped tokamak machines commonly used are limited to DT fuel. Unlike those efforts, [our] design uses an advanced accelerator beam-driven field-reversed configuration that is versatile, and can accommodate all available fusion fuel cycles.”\n\nThis fuel-agnostic reactor design, which features a sensor able to detect helium nuclei alpha particles– the only emissions from H2-boron fusion, is expected to make it possible for TAE to license its technology “on the way to its ultimate goal” of connecting the first hydrogen-boron fusion power plant to the grid in the 2030s.\n\nMore than 30 research groups around the world are racing to commercialise fusion, seen as the “perfect power” source as the planet shifts away from the CO2 emitting fossil fuels that are contributing heavily to global heating\n\nTAE highlighted that it had built five “national laboratory-scale” devices – with which it had generated and confined fusion plasma “more than 140,000 times” – and is currently building two further machines, dubbed Copernicus and Da Vinci, with a view to “demonstrating net energy and deliver power to the grid, respectively”.\n\nUS researchers at the US National Ignition Facility in California in December hailed fusion experiments that had achieved “ignition gain or energy gain”, where the energy released was greater than was pumped in the high-powered lasers used in the fusion process.": {

They bring a question or problem they have in their business. And 3-5 peers and GU coaches ask them questions and give advice on how to solve the problem.\n\nYou're able to be a fly on the wall to learn, give advice and learn from the experiences of others. \n\nJoin at least 1 Live Hot Seat per week. And pop in on as many as you would like.\nJoin in on the next Hot Seat\nLet your coach know you want to be on the Hot Seat.\nMark this complete once you've attended one Hot Seat this week. \n\nWe want to add a step before the one created by my boss to give more context for a first time attender. I wrote this first draft. I need it edited to match the voice and flow into the one above. \n\nPlease provide an edited version of this below. \n\nWe know that entrepreneurs that surround themselves with others with similar goals are more likely to succeed. Because of that fact, the hot seats were developed to bring energy to you in a way that gets you unstuck and drives action. \n\nOur goal is to help you get the most out of attending and being the client on the 30-minute hot seat by sharing tips and what to expect.\n\nThis is how it is run:\nStep #1: The question/problem is presented (5 minutes)\nStep #2: Others in the room ask clarifying questions (10 minutes)\nStep #3: Advice is given (10 minutes)\nStep #4: Takeaways are clarified (5 minutes)\nStep #1: State the problem and ask a question\nIn this step, you will share your problem and brings one question to the group. Meaning, we will only focus on one question at each hot seat.\nWhen on the hot seat:\nA) Be prepared to present one problem so the attendees can understand it quickly\nB) Keep it short and sweet. Getting feedback from the group will be shortened if you go over your 5 minutes.\nC) Be flexible. You will gain clarity as you move through the steps. As a result, your question or its framing may change. That’s okay.\n\nStep #2: Clarifying questions\nIn this step, the audience will ask clarifying questions. This is important and will often give you massive clarity around your issue. At the end of this step, we will pause and ask you to restate your question with this new clarity.\nWhen on the hot seat:\nA) Listen to questions from all different viewpoints. This is a massive benefit of having a diverse group of people in Growth University.\nB) Answer honestly. Be prepared to share numbers or details as asked to get the best feedback\nC) Assess if the question you came with is still the question you want to ask\n\nStep #3: Advice\nIn this step, the attendees will give you advice. The many ideas will be exciting. Make sure you listen to all the ideas before making any final decisions.\nWhen on the hot seat:\nA) Keep an open mind. Resist saying things like, “I’ve tried that; it didn’t work,” or “that won’t work for me” This closes you off from new opportunities.\nB) Listen and stay silent. This is not your turn to talk; you don’t want to miss a great idea because you are filling the time.\nC) Thank those for offering suggestions. Each one gets you closer to a solution.\n\nStep #4: Takeaways\nIn this step, you will state your takeaways. This is a very important step to prevent overwhelm. This often takes the full 5 minutes to ensure these are specific and actionable.\nIf you are on the hot seat:\nA) Be prepared to share your top takeaway.\nB) Stay coachable as we help you make it specific and actionable.\nC) Share your takeaways with your coach immediately after the session.\n\nBonus: Have fun!\nRemember to have fun and enjoy the experience!
