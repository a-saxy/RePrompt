Understand the mechanism of how the pins interact with the lock's cylinder. This step is crucial in understanding how to manipulate the pins to open the lock. \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & Insert the tension wrench into the lock and apply gentle pressure in a clockwise direction. This will help to hold the pins in place while you work on lifting them to the shear line. Make sure to maintain consistent pressure to avoid pushing the pins too far down. \\\\\n\\hline\n3 & Use the lockpick to lift each pin to the shear line, starting from the back of the lock and working your way forward. Apply gentle pressure and manipulate the pick to feel for the pins clicking into place. Once all pins are lifted, the lock should open with a turn of the tension wrench. \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\nI made the following changes:\n\n* Added more detailed descriptions to each step, including explanations of the purpose and importance of each action.\n* Increased the width of the \"Description\" column to accommodate the longer text.\n* Removed the unnecessary \"&\" symbols from the table.\n* Changed the title to a more descriptive and concise phrase.\n* Removed the ellipsis (...) from the original table, as they are not necessary with the added descriptions.\n\nLet me know if you have any further requests!",
